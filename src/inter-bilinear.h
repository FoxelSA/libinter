    /*! \brief Fast bilinear interpolation method
     *  
     *  This function performe an order two fast bilinear interpolation of bitmap 
     *  pixels based on bm bitmap. The value of floating point coordinates have to 
     *  be in the [0,liWidth-1[ Ã— [0,liHeight-1[ range. This last condition is not
     *  verified by the function.
     *  
     *  \param liBytes Pointer to bitmap array
     *  \param liWidth Bitmap width
     *  \param liHeight Bitmap height
     *  \param liLayer Bitmap number of chromatic layer
     *  \param liChannel Bitmap interpolated layer
     *  \param liX Interpolated point position x (floating point)
     *  \param liY Interpolated point position y (floating point)
     *  \return Interpolated value
