    //! Fast bicubic interpolation method

    //! This function performe an order four fast bicubic interpolation of bitmap 
    //! pixels based on bm bitmap. The value of floating point coordinates have to 
    //! be in the [0,liWidth-1[ Ã— [0,liHeight-1[ range. This last condition is not
    //! verified by the function.
    //! 
    //! @param liBytes Pointer to bitmap array
    //! @param liWidth Bitmap width
    //! @param liHeight Bitmap height
    //! @param liLayer Bitmap number of chromatic layer
    //! @param liChannel Bitmap interpolated layer
    //! @param liX Interpolated point position x (floating point)
    //! @param liY Interpolated point position y (floating point)
    //! @return Interpolated value
